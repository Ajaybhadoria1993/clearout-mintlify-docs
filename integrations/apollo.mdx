- **Step 2:** Upload the `.csv` file into Apollo.

That's it! You're done without the need to upgrade your current Apollo.io plan.

### Clearout Verification Status

Each email is categorized as one of the following:
- **Valid**: The email address is successfully validated through an SMTP transaction.
- **Invalid**: The email address is incorrect, non-existent, or syntactically invalid.
- **Unknown**: The mail server is temporarily unreachable. Revalidation is recommended later.
- **Catch-All**: The mail server accepts all emails sent to any address, but delivery is not guaranteed.

### Clearout Safe to Send

Clearout identifies high-quality email addresses, ensuring higher deliverability and open rates. We highly advise sending emails in bulk to addresses with a deliverability score of 1.

### Clearout Disposable

Clearout flags temporary email addresses, which are not recommended for sending emails as they increase bounce rates.
